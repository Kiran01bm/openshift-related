# General Info about OpenShift Authorization

## Two levels of RBAC control authorization
1. Cluster RBAC: Roles and bindings that are applicable across all projects
2. Local RBAC:: Roles and bindings that are scoped to a given project

## Rolebinding
1. Local role bindings can reference both cluster and local roles
2. Cluster role bindings can only reference cluster roles
3. Both cluster and local bindings used during evaluation

## Order of Authorization evaluation:
1. Cluster-wide allow rules checked
2. Locally bound allow rules checked
3. Deny by default

## Service Account Naming Convention:
1. ServiceAccount username derived from project and name: **system:serviceaccount:project:name**

## Service account Membership:
Every Service account is also a member of two groups:
1. system:serviceaccounts: Includes all service accounts in system
2. system:serviceaccounts:<project>: Includes all service accounts in a specified project

```
To allow all service accounts in all projects to view resources in monitored-project:
$ oc policy add-role-to-group view system:serviceaccounts -n monitored-project
	
To allow all service accounts in monitor project to edit resources in monitored-project:
$ oc policy add-role-to-group edit system:serviceaccounts:monitor -n monitored-project
```

## SCC:
Security context constraints (SCCs), in contrast, control:
1. Actions that pod can perform
2. What pod can access

SCCs let administrator control:
1. Use of host directories as volumes
2. SELinux context of container
3. User ID
4. Use of host namespaces and networking
5. Allocating FSGroup that owns podâ€™s volumes
6. Configuring allowable supplemental groups
7. Requiring use of read-only root file system
8. Usage of volume types
9. Configuring allowable secure computing mode (seccomp) profiles
10. Capabilities container can request to be added

## Check authorization:
To determine if you can perform a specific verb:
```
oc policy can-i <verb> <resource>
```

To determine which verbs you can perform against all namespace-scoped resources
```
oc policy can-i --list --loglevel=8
```

Indicate which users can perform an action on a resource.
```
oc policy who-can <verb> <resoruce>
```

## Impersonation
User can impersonate another user or a service account if the authorization to impersonate is granted

If User A is requesting to impersonate service account (system:serviceaccount:namespace:name):
1. OpenShift checks to ensure that User A can impersonate serviceaccount named name in namespace
2. If check fails, request fails with 403 (Forbidden) error code

To impersonate:
1. via CLI use --as=username flag
2. via REST use Impersonate-User header


**sudoers** role allows user to impersonate system:admin, which has cluster administrator permissions
1. For example, oc delete nodes --all is forbidden, but oc delete nodes --all as system:admin is allowed
2. Can add user to group using oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user sudoer <username>
